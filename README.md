# WWVB_Controlled_Clock
This project was the culmination of myself and two other Computer Engineers work. Our capstone project prior to graduating from Auburn University focused on creating the code necessary to decode a pulse-width-modulated system and translate the "timecode" received from said signal. My translating the signal we could update the clock.
